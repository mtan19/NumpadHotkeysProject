# NumpadHotkeysProject
Set of hotkeys used to type select Unicode characters, and perform specific actions. Programmed in AutoHotKey

# Future additions to the project
- Improve upon the help images so that they can be dynamically updated
- Separation of each numpad key to its own unique .ahk script
- Have an overarching GUI to allow individual scripts to be enabled/disabled and modified
- (long term goal) Port the project into a universal language so that it is OS-independent
